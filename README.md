# Linear Regression Implementation from Scratch

## Introduction
Demonstrates developing a Linear Regression model from scratch, discussing theory, and comparing effectiveness with Scikit-learn's implementation.

## Installation
Requires numpy, pandas, matplotlib. Install with `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib`.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Includes dataset analysis, handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting into training and test sets.

## Linear Regression Implementation
Involves defining hypothesis and cost functions, and optimizing with gradient descent.

## Comparison with Scikit-learn
Evaluates custom model against Scikit-learn's using MSE and R-squared metrics.

## Visualization
Creates scatter plots for feature relationships and compares model predictions with actual values.

## Results & Conclusion
Discusses accuracy, parameter insights, and potential future work directions.
